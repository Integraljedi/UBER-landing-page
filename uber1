Uber1

<h2>Hey everyone.

I want to show you how to make some quick cash driving for UBER. 

You can land a big comission and hiring bonus by completing 20 trips, which is doable in one long work day or two half days... its about 12hrs of work on average.  

What you can expect:</h2>
<h1>~$650 If you have or can borrow a qualifying car</h1>
<h1>~$550 If you don't have a car and need to get one for this (its possible)</h1>
<h1>~$750 If you have driven for Lyft in the past or are currently driving for Lyft and want to try UBER</h1>
<h2>
Qualifications:

Clean-ish driving record. You have no DUI's, or driving related felonies..

Pretty clean criminal record.

21 Years old.

You have not driven for Uber before.


Really .

If you already have a qualifying car (2000 or newer, 4 doors, looks ok), then I can probably set you up immediately. Ill give you a credit card with a $100 limit, and I will have it activated after you finish your first trip. Orientations are at the good earth every day or by conference call at 10:00 am every day. Email me to confirm each day, because this could change to a different location. Take that first trip, see what you think.

If you don't like it, take the $100 and go do whatever you want.

If you dig it, complete 19 more trips. It will take you about 8-10 hrs if you follow my guidance, you will get about $200 average for those trips, and you will get another $300 bonus for giving it a try. 

If you don't have a car, I can lend you my 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid for the day - but you may have to wait in line for that, because I only have one car. 

Interested?

Hit me up with the term UBER in all caps as the subject line, with your contact info including phone number, and I will get you dialed in early next week. Tuesday or wednesday.
